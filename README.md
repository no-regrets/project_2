No Regrets - 

## Value Add Proposal

Application Where Users can track their drinking sessions & know how long before they are legally sober again. An app that protects you from your drunker self. 
"No Regrets - Your sober wingman, so you don't have to be. Protecting yourself from yourself since 2018" 

## Tech Stack
The application demonstrates the ability to use [Express](https://expressjs.com/) with a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server while utilizing [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)

Sequelize, Handlebars, Bootstrap, Moment.js, jQuery
Deployed using Heroku with Data.
SQL Database to track our Internal Users / Sessions
Drink Database to import Drink Items w/ alcohol content.
BAC Database. We may need to convert a public table to our own private table.
