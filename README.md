Deployed using Heroku with Data.

## MVP	
PHASE ONE	
* Create User Account that can track drinking log, across multiple sessions w/ Persistance

PHASE TWO	
* Addition of Drinks starts a timer until you are sober again based on BAC table/database/api. Creating a budget that will countdown how much money you've spent. 
* Once over the limit, implement additional functionality. Call an Uber/ Either as a simple link or an API

PHASE THREE	
* Combat the "Hangover Gremlin" by drinking water.	
* Target BAC levels / Drinks until drunk.
